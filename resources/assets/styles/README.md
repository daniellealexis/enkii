# Styles Structure

Top level files in this folder are intended to be their own bundles.

Substyles are the base styles for shared things like variables, typography, and layout helpers.

BaseComponents folder is for simple UI components like buttons and inputs.

Modules (or maybe rename to components), are bigger components that might consist of baseComponents.
